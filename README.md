# CardGPT — Card Matching Game Generator

Live demo: https://cardgpt.faizluqman.my

CardGPT lets you create printable matching-card games quickly. This README combines a short end-user guide (how to use and print your decks) with developer notes (setup, API, and configuration).

## For end users (non-technical)

### What CardGPT does

- Pick a category (for example: animals, food, colors).
- The site generates pairs of related words for that category.
- You can preview the pairs, create a printable PDF, download it, or save the deck to your account.
- You can preview the pairs, create a printable PDF, download it, save the deck to your account, or (if logged in) share it with the community.

### Quick start (3 steps)

1. Open https://cardgpt.faizluqman.my
2. Enter a category and choose the number of pairs
3. Click "Generate", then "Create PDF" and "Download" or "Save"
4. (Optional) If you're logged in, choose "Share" or "Publish" to upload the deck to the community gallery

### Printing tips

- Use your printer scaling set to 100% or "Actual size" to keep card dimensions accurate.
- For sturdier cards, print on 200–300 gsm card stock.
- If the words appear too large or overlap, try fewer pairs or landscape orientation.
- Cut along the faint border lines (if present) and use a paper trimmer for neat results.

### Troubleshooting (end users)

- Nothing happens when you click Generate: check your internet connection and try again.
- Download fails or file is blocked: try another browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and check your downloads folder.
- Forgot password or login issues: use the site’s password reset or the Contact link.

### Privacy & safety

- Content is generated by a language model and filtered for family-friendliness, but please review decks before giving them to children.
- Saved decks are private unless you explicitly share them.

## For developers

### Key features

- Generate themed word-pair cards
- Export PDFs
- Save/manage decks with user association

### Developer quickstart

Requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- A language model API key (set `API_KEY`)

Backend setup:

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Create a folder to store generated PDFs
export PDF_UPLOAD_FOLDER="$PWD/pdfs" && mkdir -p "$PDF_UPLOAD_FOLDER"
# Set environment variables (example)
export SECRET_KEY='replace-with-strong-secret'
export API_KEY='your-api-key'
export JWT_SECRET='jwt-secret-if-using-jwt'
python restapi.py
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### API overview

- `POST /generate` — generate word pairs. Body: `{ "category": "animals", "num_pairs": 8 }`
- `POST /generate-and-save` — generate and save a deck (authenticated)
- `POST /auth/register` — register (session blueprint)
- `POST /auth/login` — login (session blueprint)
- `POST /save` — save decks (JWT-based endpoint)
- `GET /cards/my-cards` — list saved cards (session blueprint)
- `GET /cards/card/<id>/download` — download saved PDF
- `GET /community` — public list of recently shared decks

If you are logged in, you can publish decks to the community. Published decks appear in the `/community` listing for others to view and download.

See the backend modules (`backend/restapi.py`, `backend/cards.py`, `backend/auth.py`, `backend/main.py`) for full behavior and payload details.

### Environment variables

- `SECRET_KEY` — Flask secret key (required for sessions)
- `API_KEY` — language model API key
- `JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing secret (if using JWT flows)
- `PDF_UPLOAD_FOLDER` — where generated PDFs are stored
- `SUPABASE_URL` / `DATABASE_URL` — Postgres connection if using `backend/database.py`

### Notes & recommendations

- The repository currently contains two DB/auth approaches: SQLAlchemy + Flask-Login and a separate psycopg2 `DatabaseManager`. Pick one to simplify maintenance.
- Validate and sanitize language-model output before saving or printing.
- Ensure `SECRET_KEY` is set in production and that cookie flags are configured securely.
