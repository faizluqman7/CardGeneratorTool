CardGPT — Playful Card Matching Game Generator

Welcome to CardGPT — an easy way to create printable matching-card games from categories you choose.

Website
- Open the app at: https://cardgpt.faizluqman.my  (If this address doesn’t work, try adding/removing `www.` or contact the developer.)

What it does (in plain English)
- Pick a category (animals, food, colors, etc.).
- The site generates pairs of related words for that category.
- You can preview the word pairs, create a printable PDF of cards, and download or save your deck.
- Saved decks can be re-downloaded later or shared with others.

How to use
1. Enter a category in the search box (for example: "animals").
2. Choose how many pairs you want (common defaults are 8 or 10).
3. Click Generate. The app will show the generated word pairs.
4. Click "Create PDF" to make a printable sheet of cards.
5. Click "Download" to save the PDF to your computer, or "Save" to store it in your account for later.

Tips for printing
- The PDF is formatted for standard paper sizes. Use your printer’s "Actual size" or 100% scaling for best results.
- For sturdier cards, print on card stock and cut along the borders.
- If the words are long, choose fewer pairs or landscape printing to keep text large and legible.

Accounts and saving
- You can create a free account to save decks and download them again later.
- When saving, the app stores the word pairs and a PDF file so you can access your decks from different devices.

Privacy and safety
- The app uses a language model to generate words. Content is filtered for family-friendliness, but occasionally unexpected outputs can occur — please review before printing for children.
- The app does not publish your saved decks publicly unless you choose to share them.

Troubleshooting
- Nothing happens when you click Generate: check your internet connection and try again.
- PDF won’t download: try a different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) or check your browser’s pop-up/download settings.
- Login problems: try resetting your password or use the "Contact" option on the site.

Accessibility
- The site aims to be keyboard-friendly and readable; if you need assistance or spot accessibility problems, please report them.

Need help or want to report a bug?
- Use the Contact link on the website or open an issue in the project repository (search for the project on GitHub under the developer’s account).

Quick FAQ
- Q: Can I customize fonts or card sizes?  
  A: Not currently — PDFs are generated with a readable font and standard card sizes. Tell us if you need other sizes.

- Q: Can I share decks with friends?  
  A: Yes — save a deck and share the downloaded PDF, or use any sharing option provided on the site.
